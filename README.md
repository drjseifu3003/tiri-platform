# Tiri

Tiri is a digital event infrastructure platform built for photo studios and event organizers in Ethiopia — starting with weddings and expanding into a pan-African event ecosystem.

Our strategic entry point is high-quality, culturally designed digital wedding invitation templates that photo studios cannot resist offering to their clients.

---

## Vision

Tiri aims to become the event infrastructure layer for Africa.

We start with wedding digital invitations and grow into:

- Guest management
- Event check-in systems
- Post-event media delivery
- Studio infrastructure tools

Long term, Tiri evolves into a full event operating system across Africa.

## Our Strategic Advantage

Photo studios are the gatekeepers of weddings.

Instead of competing with them, Tiri empowers them.

Our core wedge:

### Premium Wedding Invitation Card Templates

- Designed specifically for Ethiopian cultures and regions
- Religious variations (Orthodox, Muslim, Protestant)
- Traditional + modern styles
- Studio branding included
- Mobile-first digital experience
- Easy to customize

Studios get:

- A new product to sell
- Increased perceived professionalism
- Recurring digital revenue
- Zero technical burden

This makes Tiri difficult to resist.

## Why Tiri Exists

Wedding digital invitations in Ethiopia are fragmented:

- Design-only solutions
- No infrastructure
- No guest tracking
- No structured media delivery

Tiri combines:

Design + Infrastructure + Studio Distribution

We are not just building invitation templates.

We are building event infrastructure — starting with the most emotionally important event: weddings.
